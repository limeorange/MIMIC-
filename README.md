### ‚òÅÔ∏è MIMIC_III
- [MIMIC-III Documentation](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iii/)
- MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a time-series electronic medical record (EMR) dataset tracking and recording medical events during the ICU stays of more than 40,000 patients from 2001 to 2012 at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. It was anonymized and structured by the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology and released in 2015.
